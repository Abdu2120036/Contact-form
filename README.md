## Issues
Couldn't change the background-color of the radio input buttons when they are active(pressed).

The choices between general and suuport is not a choice. The program is acting as if they are a separate entity to each other. Need to look into it. 

Adjust the style of the alert divs. (Done)

Couldnt adjust the file, starting over.
